# STIR/SHAKEN CA Ecosystem Compliance

[Approved Certificate Authorities](https://authenticate.iconectiv.com/approved-certification-authorities) in the STIR/SHAKEN ecosystem are required to meet technical requirements from [ATIS-1000080](https://access.atis.org/apps/group_public/document.php?document_id=62163) and policy requirements from the supporting CA ecosystemâ€™s [Certificate Policy](https://authenticate.iconectiv.com/documents-authenticate).

This report is generated using [Zlint](https://github.com/zmap/zlint) a tool commonly used to asses CA ecosystem compliance with such requirements. The tests used to generate this report are currently not part of the main Zlint distribution but can be found [here](https://github.com/martinisecurity/zlint).

\* The percent of certificates per issuer is calculated against total certificates from all issuers.\
\*\* The percent of errors, warnings and notices is calculated against total observed certificates from the specified issuer.\
\*\*\* Tests use the ATIS 1000080 and Certificate Policy versions release dates to determine if tests are ran. Certificates issued before these dates are not executed as the rules may not have been enforce at the time.\
\*\*\*\* For information on failed certificate repository retrievals see this [report](URL/README.md).\
\*\*\*\*\* 273 certificates skipped because they are currently expired.\
\*\*\*\*\*\* 1 certificates skipped because they are not currently trusted by the STI-PA.
