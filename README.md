# STIR/SHAKEN CA Ecosystem Compliance

[Approved Certificate Authorities](https://ecosystemcompliance.martinisecurity.com/#:~:text=Approved%20Certificate%20Authorities) in the STIR/SHAKEN ecosystem are required to meet technical requirements from [ATIS-1000080](https://access.atis.org/apps/group_public/document.php?document_id=62163) and policy requirements from the supporting CA ecosystemâ€™s [Certificate Policy](https://authenticate.iconectiv.com/documents-authenticate).

This report is broken int two parts:
1. One generated using [Zlint](https://github.com/zmap/zlint) a tool commonly used to asses CA ecosystem compliance with such requirements. The tests used to generate this report are currently not part of the main [Zlint](https://github.com/martinisecurity/zlint) distribution but can be found here.
2. One generated with a custom script that eumerates the known STIR/SHAKEN certificates and asses each repository against the current rule set . The source for this test can be found here while the report itself can be found [here](REPOS/README.md).

## Certificate Repository URL

## Details

\* The percent of certificates per issuer is calculated against total certificates from all issuers.\
\*\* The percent of errors, warnings and notices is calculated against total observed certificates from the specified issuer.\
\*\*\* Tests use the ATIS-1000080 and Certificate Policy versions release dates to determine if tests are ran. Certificates issued before these dates are not executed as the rules may not have been enforce at the time.
